Zoro attempts to utilize his Three-Sword Style techniques against Eric's Sickle-Sickle Fruit powers, which allow the Marine to create razor-sharp wind blades that can attack from multiple angles simultaneously.

Once his friends are secure aboard their ship, Luffy demonstrates his rubber powers by stretching his arm to an incredible length, grabbing Zoro from the ruins and pulling him to safety aboard the ship, allowing the entire crew to escape Eric's pursuit.

Detailed Synopsis: Admiral Nelson, who has harbored suspicions about Eric's true motives and methods throughout their partnership, decides to take direct command of the operation by mobilizing the entire 8th Marine Fleet. Nelson reveals his master strategy: he orders his warships to form a complete circle around the Going Merry, then deploys heavy chains between the vessels to create an inescapable naval prison that prevents any possibility of escape. With the Straw Hat Pirates trapped within this maritime cage, Nelson's fleet begins a devastating artillery bombardment designed to sink their ship and capture the Millennium Dragon. Meanwhile, Eric abandons his Marine allies and independently boards a small raft with Apis and Sennenryu, attempting to escape with his prizes while the Straw Hats are under attack. However, Nelson's distrust of Eric proves justified when he orders his ships to target Eric's raft as well, viewing the mercenary as a liability rather than an asset. When Eric strikes down Apis in his desperation, the ancient Sennenryu is moved to protect the young girl who has shown him such kindness. The Millennium Dragon summons his remaining strength to take flight and launch a direct attack against Nelson's flagship, but the Admiral's forces respond with concentrated gunfire that brings down the majestic creature.

Through their connection, Luffy comprehends the true nature of the Millennium Dragons' legendary cycle and the significance of Lost Island in their mythology. As Sennenryu breathes his last, a miraculous event unfolds: an entire flock of dragons appears in the sky, returning to their ancestral home after a thousand-year absence. Simultaneously, the ocean begins to churn and bubble as Lost Island—which was actually Warship Island all along—begins its legendary resurface from the depths of the sea. The island's emergence is a cataclysmic event that has been prophesied for centuries, marking the return of the dragons to their sacred nesting ground. Filled with righteous fury over the treatment of Sennenryu and the threat to the dragon species, Luffy channels his anger into a devastating counterattack against Admiral Nelson's fleet.

Detailed Synopsis: Following the tragic death of Sennenryu (Ryuuji), Apis mourns the loss of her ancient dragon friend, but Luffy provides comfort by explaining the eternal nature of dragon rebirth cycles. His words prove prophetic when a dragon egg cracks open nearby, revealing a young dragon with Ryuuji's distinctive eyes, symbolizing the continuation of life and the fulfillment of ancient promises. However, the peaceful moment is shattered when Admiral Nelson, having survived the destruction of his fleet, encounters Eric in the aftermath of the battle. The mercenary, showing his true treacherous nature, promptly kills Nelson rather than face accountability for his failures. Eric then turns his attention to the vulnerable dragon flock, threatening to capture or destroy them for his own profit. This final act of cruelty triggers Luffy's ultimate confrontation with Eric, where the Straw Hat captain's determination and rubber powers prove superior to the mercenary's wind-based abilities. Luffy's decisive victory sends Eric flying far from the island, eliminating the threat to the dragons permanently. With the Millennium Dragons now safe in their ancestral home, the Straw Hat Pirates bid farewell to Apis and set course for their original destination: the Grand Line. Their journey takes them to the legendary Reverse Mountain, where the ocean's powerful currents flow upward against gravity, creating a natural waterway that leads ships into the Grand Line. As they navigate this treacherous passage, Eric makes one final desperate attempt to stop them, but Nami's quick thinking and tactical skills allow her to outmaneuver the mercenary, sending him tumbling into the rushing waters and ending his threat once and for all.
