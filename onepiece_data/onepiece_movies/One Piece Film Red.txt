Synopsis
The story is set on the "Island of Music" Elegia, where Uta, the world's greatest diva, holds her first ever live concert and reveals herself to the public. The Straw Hats, pirates, Marines and fans from across the world gather to enjoy Uta's voice, which has been described as "otherworldly". However, the event begins with the shocking revelation that Uta is the daughter of Shanks.[3]

Plot
The Straw Hat Pirates travel to the island of Elegia where a famous singer named Uta will have her debut concert. Uta performs her opening song "New Genesis" and Luffy goes on stage to reunite with her, revealing that the two of them know each other because Uta is the daughter of "Red-Haired" Shanks. They met 12 years ago when Shanks was docked at Dawn Island, but one day he returned without her, claiming she had left to pursue a career as a singer.

Some Big Mom Pirates then attempt to kidnap Uta because the Empress wants her Devil Fruit, but Uta easily subdues them through her power brought by the Uta Uta no Mi, singing "I'm Invincible". Her power allows the user to create things through music, so when she sings everybody falls in her traps. Afterwards, Uta tells Luffy that he should stop being a pirate, as she is going to make this concert last forever and create a world with only happiness and peace. When the Straw Hats resist the idea, Uta attacks and captures all of them while singing "Backlight"; only Luffy manages to escape as a result of being rescued by Trafalgar Law and Bartolomeo. Meanwhile, the Five Elders are monitoring the concert from Mary Geoise. They view Uta's power as a great threat to the world, and they wonder if she's a member of the Figarland Family. Marine Fleet Admiral Sakazuki orders a convoy of battleships led by Admirals Kizaru and Fujitora to go to Elegia and subdue her.

As Luffy's group are being pursued by Uta and other concertgoers, they enter Elegia's castle where they meet Gordon, Uta's adoptive father and former king of Elegia. Gordon reveals that he took in Uta after Elegia was destroyed 12 years ago, an incident attributed to Shanks and his crew, who by all accounts plundered the island for its treasure and abandoned Uta. Gordon raised Uta to be a great musician and kept her sheltered from the outside world, but when she attained worldwide fame through a new model Livestream Den Den Mushi, she began to learn of the suffering inflicted by pirates on a great number of her fans. Uta then arrives forcing Luffy's group to escape, and Gordon pleads with her to not carry out her secret plan. However, Uta reveals she found an inscription of a song that can unleash a great power and immobilizes Gordon.

Luffy's group comes across members of SWORD, Koby and Helmeppo, and agents of CP0, Blueno and Kalifa who are operating undercover for the World Government. Koby reveals that the Uta Uta no Mi allows Uta to send people into a dream known as the Uta World by singing to them. They and everyone else who watched the concert are already trapped in this dream world, whose reality is completely controlled by Uta. The Uta World ceases to exist whenever Uta falls asleep; however, Uta has been consuming a mushroom called Wake-shrooms that keeps her awake at all hours and drastically shortens her lifespan. If Uta were to die, everyone in the Uta World would be trapped there forever. In the real world, the Marines fleet arrives at Elegia to find the concertgoers all sleeping. They block their hearing to nullify Uta's voice as she sings "Fleeting Lullaby", but she assumes control of the concertgoers to overwhelm the Marines and remove their hearing blockers. Rob Lucci informs the Five Elders know that Uta has mere hours left to live and that if she dies, 70% of the world's population watching the concert in streaming would be trapped.

The Straw Hats manage to free themselves and head towards the castle to find a weakness in Uta's power. In the library, Robin discovers that there is a way to make the worlds converge by summoning Tot Musica, a demonic entity whose existence spans both worlds. If Tot Musica is attacked simultaneously in both worlds, those in the Uta World will return to reality. Uta resumes her concert in the dream world, but her audience begins to resist the idea of living in her world forever. Growing more and more unstable, Uta transforms all of them into inanimate objects. Luffy then confronts Uta and is told by Gordon that he has been joined by Shanks and the Red Hair Pirates in the real world.

Shanks tries to help Uta, but Sakazuki orders for the Marines to fire on her without regard for the concertgoers, forcing Shanks and his crew to go on the defensive. Slipping into delirium from the wake-shrooms, Uta sings the forbidden "Tot Musica" song summoning the demon by that name. When Luffy tries to stop Uta she tries to kill him, but Gordon takes the blow instead. He reveals that Tot Musica was actually the one who destroyed Elegia 12 years ago after Uta accidentally summoned him, and Shanks left Uta on Elegia afterward so she could pursue a singing career without being a wanted pirate. Despite this confession, Uta ends up being consumed by Tot Musica as it moves to consume both versions of Elegia, easily overpowering the pirates and Marines. However, Usopp is able to attain a mental link with his father Yasopp via Observation Haki, and this allows the two of them to coordinate simultaneous attacks between the forces of both worlds. Shanks remembers the moment when he found Uta as a baby inside a treasure chest on a pirate's ship, adopting her. He thinks it was destiny because he was found by Gol D. Roger in a similar way. After a long and arduous battle, Luffy and Shanks strike the finishing blows to defeat Tot Musica in the same moment. However, since it has already consumed everyone on Elegia, those in the Uta World do not return. Uta rejects an antidote from Shanks to cure the effects of the wake-shrooms in order to sing "The World's Continuation" and to bring everyone back from the dream world. In her final moments she confesses she wanted to make people happy in a dream world without pirates but that still she wanted to see Shanks again. The Marine forces move to seize her, but Shanks repels them with his Haki. As the Marines retreat, Shanks and Uta reconcile as father and daughter.

Luffy wakes up on the Thousand Sunny after his crew has already departed Elegia. He is able to see the Red Force sailing away and looks on at the crew standing over a coffin, presumably containing Uta's body. In the ending credits, Uta's childhood song "Where the Wind Blows" is heard and various characters over the world listen. In the post-credits scene, Luffy sits on top of Sunny and tries to speak to it while reminiscing of Uta. Luffy and his crew continue their adventure as he proclaims his dream to become the Pirate King.

Trivia
Film Red Volume 104
Volume 104's alternate cover

This is currently the highest-grossing One Piece film at over 15 billion yen, having surpassed One Piece Film: Z's previous record of 6.87 billion yen in only 10 days.[77]
This is the first film since One Piece 3D: Straw Hat Chase to have its title revealed when it was first announced.
The director of this film, Gorō Taniguchi, previously directed the OVA One Piece - Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack, which came out in 1998—24 years before this movie was set to release, and over a year before the release of the first episode of the anime.
The OVA's titular antagonist, Ganzack, has a cameo appearance in this movie.
This is the first movie to feature Jinbe as a member of the Straw Hat Pirates.
Uta was created due to Oda being tired of drawing legendary old men (presumably referring to characters like Shiki, Z, Gild Tesoro, and Douglas Bullet who headlined four out of the last five movies) and wanting to develop a major female character instead.[78]
The events of the film, while not canon, would likely take place after the Wano Country Arc, given that Jinbe is part of and sailing with the Straw Hat Pirates, and the group demonstrates most of the abilities they revealed or acquired during that story arc. They have also previously defeated and are acquainted with Big Mom's children and their powers.[79]
However, this movie shows Big Mom as still being an Emperor and alive & well, despite being presumed dead, along with Kaidou, by the world after being defeated in Wano.
Additionally, a member of the audience refers to Luffy as the Fifth Emperor, instead of one of the Four, and Koby and Pudding have not yet been kidnapped by the Blackbeard Pirates.
This is the first One Piece film to be screened in IMAX Theaters.[80]
This is the first film to have an accompanying album, Uta no Uta: ONE PIECE FILM RED, sung by the main character releasing a couple of songs before the film's opening day.
The movie marks Blueno and Kalifa's first appearances in the story since CP9's Independent Report.
This is the first movie to feature the Five Elders, the Big Mom Pirates and the Red Hair Pirates.
Two of Uta's soldiers hold lances to the throat of a kneeling Luffy visually mimicking the execution pose of Roger.
Luffy's Gear 5 form is seen for a brief moment - a short zoom into his face, a quick shot from behind, and a distant view of his body.
Lisa Ortiz, the voice of Chopper from the 4Kids Entertainment dub of the series, makes her return to the series as the voice of Sunny and several background roles.
Three special booklets were distributed at the cinema in Japan: Volume 4000000000, Volume 4／4, and Volume 4000000001.
One of the special rewards distributed in cinemas in Japan was an alternate cover of Volume 104, of which 500,000 were given. The cover depicted Shanks and young Uta and Luffy, and was drawn by Eiichiro Oda.[81]
